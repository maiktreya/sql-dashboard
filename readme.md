## SQL Dashboard

@Miguel Garcia-Duch

Minimal streamlit webapp showcasing a sql interface which allows retrieving data from queries in a sample db and returns:

- A tidy version of the run query
- A graphviz diagram approximating the relations implied by the clause
- An interactive data table to inspect the result
- The capability of exporting the table both to csv or to xlsx
